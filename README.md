- 👋 Hi, I’m Murali Kadambi

My background is in electronics, but I have been mostly working in ecommerce. Now with the Covid-19 lockdowns, I'm moving to find work in ML/AI/iOT fields. Few ML interviews that did not pan out put me on the quest to implement some CV code and make them available on github. Let's see where this journey takes me.

- 👀 I’m interested in a wide range of technologies that include Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, internet of things (iOT), Virtual/Augmented Reality

- 🌱 I’m currently learning iOT and NLP

- 🌱 I’m currently implementing few projects in Computer Vision, NLP and iOT

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any new technology with an interesting application
